## 🎯 Business Problem  
Blinkit, as a quick-commerce platform, generates massive volumes of sales data every day.  
However, raw data in Excel format does not provide immediate insights into:  
- Which product categories drive the most revenue  
- How sales are trending over time  
- Who are the top customers and their contribution  
- How customer demand is shifting  

Without visualization, it becomes challenging for business leaders to make timely decisions.

## 💡 Solution Approach  
To solve this, a **Power BI dashboard** was developed with the following goals:  
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** → Prepare raw Excel data for structured analysis.  
2. **Data Modeling** → Design fact and dimension tables with proper relationships.  
3. **KPI Tracking with DAX** → Create measures for revenue, orders, basket value, and category performance.  
4. **Dashboard Development** → Build a single interactive dashboard that gives a **360° view of sales performance**.
